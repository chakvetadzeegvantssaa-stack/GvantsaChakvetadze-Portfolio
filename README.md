QA Manual Portfolio
“Quality is not an act, it’s a habit.”

Welcome to my QA Portfolio — a space where I’m building my professional path as a Junior Manual QA Tester.
Here, I’ve gathered my practical work: test cases, bug reports, checklists, and learning progress — everything that represents how I apply theory in real testing scenarios.

This portfolio reflects not only what I’ve learned but how I work — with structure, precision, and a focus on continuous growth.

🧩 About Me

I’m a Junior Manual QA Tester with hands-on experience testing live web and mobile projects.
I started with a strong foundation in QA theory and have developed practical skills through active project work and collaboration in real testing environments.

My goal is simple — to deliver clean, reliable, and user-friendly software through careful testing and attention to every detail.

Highlights of My Experience:

Worked on several web and mobile applications as part of QA teams, focusing on functional, UI/UX, and regression testing.

Reported over 100+ issues using Jira and ClickUp, including critical bugs and localization issues.

Created structured test cases, checklists, and test scenarios for production-level systems.

Participated in beta testing phases for products before public release.

Contributed to QA processes for live client projects under NDA.
