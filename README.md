# QA Manual Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Portfolio — a space where I’m building my professional path as a **Junior Manual QA Tester**.  
Here, I’ve gathered my practical work: test cases, bug reports, checklists, and learning progress — everything that represents how I apply theory in real testing scenarios.

This portfolio reflects not only what I’ve learned but **how I work** — with structure, precision, and a focus on continuous growth.
