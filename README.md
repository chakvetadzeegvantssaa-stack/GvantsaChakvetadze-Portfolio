Welcome to my **QA Manual Testing Portfolio**!

## 👩‍💻 **About Me**

Hi, I’m a **Manual QA Tester** who’s passionate about improving product quality and user experience.  
I believe that **every bug found early saves time, cost, and reputation**.  
I’m skilled at identifying software issues, analyzing system behavior, and communicating clearly with development teams.  

> 🧠 *“Testing is not to prove there are no bugs — it’s to reveal them before users do.”*
